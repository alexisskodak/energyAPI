# Energy API

This project is in a very early phase of development and it's meant so far as 
a fast implementation of a data processing backend. Data is extracted from publicly
available .csv files, then cleaned and minimally processed by pandas then json encoded
to be accessible by a frontend, currently a Vue Dashboard-type web-app.
